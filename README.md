I am not allowed to publish the purpose of this project,
but it's in general a mini full-stack web development project.

These are the topics that this project includes:

Technologies and labs:
```
Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, JQuery, Bootstrap, Expressjs, Cors
```

Concepts:
```
Same Origin Policy (SOP)
Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
XSS attack prevention
REST
AJAX
Wireshark, packet inspection
Non-relational databases
```

Related Topics:
```
Microservices
Docker
Kubernetes
Relational databses
npm
mocha
chi
source-control
```

I supplied the mode modules, so it's not necessary to run the commands (just open index.html).
I provided the commands if you want to build from scratch:
```
npm install express
npm install cors
npm install mongoose
npm install faker

node create_db.js
node app.js

open index.html
```
